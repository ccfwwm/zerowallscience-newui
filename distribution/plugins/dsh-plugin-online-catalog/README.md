# @zerowall/dsh-plugin-online-catalog

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This optional bundle adds **Online plugins and skills** to Settings and an entry to Updates. It reads independently published Qiniu manifests when opened or refreshed. Installing compatible additions does not require an EXE or Host Runtime release; a plugin change can still require restarting the application. Only explicit user actions install content.

## Use this package

Install this entry once through the existing Plugins page using `@zerowall/dsh-plugin-online-catalog@0.1.1`, or fully quit Desktop and run its bundled command:

```text
dsh plugin --profile desktop add @zerowall/dsh-plugin-online-catalog@0.1.1
```

Reopen Desktop, then open **Settings → Online plugins and skills**. **Refresh catalog** retrieves new entries. Each item has its own Install or Update action. **Update installed items** updates only installed items with newer versions; it stops on failure or when a restart is required. New items always require individual selection. The `zerowall-online-catalog` bundle row mounts the Host service and its client views beside the existing plugin and Skills managers.

## Catalog configuration

The default plugin URL is `https://zerowall.chengxunkeji.cn/stable/catalog/plugins.json`; the skill URL is `https://zerowall.chengxunkeji.cn/stable/catalog/skills.json`. Set `pluginIndexUrl`, `skillIndexUrl`, `home`, `fetchTimeoutMs`, `maxCatalogBytes` or `maxSkillBytes` on the bundle row to override them. Defaults allow 15 seconds per operation, 4 MiB per catalog and 64 MiB per skill archive. Endpoints must use HTTPS without credentials or fragments. Downloads reject redirects. A failed refresh retains the valid side of the previous snapshot and prevents installation until a refresh succeeds.

Plugin catalogs use [market format 1](../../../packages/util/plugin-market-index/README.md). The existing plugin manager owns compatibility, build approval, package installation, rollback and diagnostic logs. A failed operation retains its complete manager result, including output and log paths. Skill catalogs use schema 1 with unique ids, versions, localized titles and descriptions, immutable HTTPS ZIP URLs, byte counts, SHA-256 hashes and exact skill names. Length or hash failure leaves existing skills unchanged. The Skills importer owns extraction and replacement; successful updates restore prior global enablement, enable new skills, and retain workspace overrides. Local skill receipts are written atomically below the selected DSH home.

Publish immutable packages and archives first, then update the [catalog sources](../../../market/catalog/README.md) and refresh the CDN keys. Existing clients discover additions on the next explicit refresh; no polling interval or background installation is enabled.

## Model experience

This bundle adds no tools or prompt content. Installed and enabled skills become available through the existing skill registry.

<a id="known-limitations"></a>
## Known limitations

Git sources support first installation; registry updates use the existing manager's update support. Read-only or unsupported package sources remain manageable through Plugins. An incompatible DSH version requires a compatible package or a Host Runtime update. New host APIs cannot be delivered by a catalog alone. A skill import that fails after publication can leave imported files disabled or partially configured; the UI reports this state and asks the user to inspect Skills before retrying. Skill version receipts describe catalog installs, not arbitrary local edits.
